## 分析原因
shutdown immediate 报错如下

metelink解释
Background processes are hanging/not started correctly during the previous startup of this database.
Hence the semaphores and shared memory segments are not getting detached properly now during shutdown.

## 官方处理建议

````base
1. Verify that there are no background processes owned by "oracle" , if there are kill them

$ ps -ef | grep ora_ | grep $ORACLE_SID



2. Remove shared memory and semaphores:



A) Check for shared memory and semaphores

$ ipcs -mt (if there is anything owned by oracle remove it)

$ ipcrm -m [ID] (to remove it)



B) Check and remove semaphores

$ ipcs -sbt (if there is anything owned by oracle remove it)

$ ipcrm -s [ID] (to remove it)



C) Remove sga and lk file

$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/dbs

$ rm sgadef<SID>.dbf (removing sga file)

$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/lk<sid> (removing lk... flies)



D) If database is down, try to bring up oracle one step at a time:

$ sqlplus /nolog

SQL> startup nomount pfile = ...[path]

SQL> alter database mount;

SQL> alter database open;\



Otherwise, exit current SQL*Plus session and verify the following environment variables are set.

echo $ORACLE_HOME

echo $ORACLE_SID (echo %ORACLE_SID% on Windows)

Then, Execute the following:

sqlplus / as sysdba

shutdown abort

exit

sqlplus / as sysdba

startup
